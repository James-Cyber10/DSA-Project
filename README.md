# DSA-Project
A simple psuedocode/algorithm based project for creating a music player 
The music player, playlist, tracklist, repeat feature, search feature, and add/remove feature are all initialised by the code above. Then, songs from the playlist are played on the music player. Searches for specific songs may be done, and the tracks are replayed as necessary. The last option is to add or delete tracks as needed
